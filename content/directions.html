		<p><strong>How to find my office.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Office </strong>number 3.124</p>
<p>My office is in the upmost corner of the MPI, facing north.<br />
To get there:<br />
&#8211; enter the main building, and go to the upmost floor (2nd floor)<br />
&#8211; find the bridge that connects the main building with the annex, close to room 2.11<br />
&#8211; in the annex, go to the upmost (3rd) floor<br />
&#8211; my office is at the end of one of the four corridors, facing away from the main building</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Getting to the MPI for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS)</strong></p>
<p>Address: Am Fassberg 17, 37077 Gottingen</p>
<p><strong>By bus</strong> &#8211; from the train station or city center, take any of the bus lines 21/22/23 in direction of Fassberg or Nikolausberg. Exit at the stop Fassberg and turn left into the street &#8220;Am Fassberg&#8221; to reach the Max Planck Campus (i.e. the only group of buildings you see in the vicinity of the bus station). The MPI-DS is a new building on your right hand side, uphill. The bus ride takes about 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>By taxi</strong> &#8211; take one of the taxis that is waiting in front of the train station. The trip will take about 15 minutes and cost about 15-20 Euros.</p>
