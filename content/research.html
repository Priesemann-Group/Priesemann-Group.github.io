                A classical problem when investigating complex systems is to infer their properties from measurements. However, these measurements are subject to uncertainties. For example, one can only sample a tiny fraction of all neurons in a brain. We showed how such subsampling can cause systematic biases and how to overcome them with subsampling-invariant estimators. More generally, we employ tools from Bayesian inference to include the uncertainty of data, e.g. from disease case numbers, for reliable estimates of collective properties.

                We want to understand how living neural networks process information. Does this require emergent correlations of their collective dynamics, as prevalent in so-called critical states, or does it require minimal redundancy and fast responses, as observed for so-called balanced states? We revisited these opposing hypotheses by analyzing spiking activity using subsampling-invariant approaches (see above) to find that many species operate in a novel regime, where they could flexibly tune computational properties in between critical and balanced state. We study mechanism of how neural networks self-organize towards either the critical or the balanced state depending on task requirements - a property that we call “dynamic, adaptive computation”.

                Information theory provides a natural language to quantify information processing independently of the imposed semantics. Hence, it enables us on the one hand to quantify the computational capacity of living and artificial neural networks. On the other hand, it provides the formal framework to derive learning rules systematically. Learning, from the synapse to the network level, tunes the performance of living systems, and unlocks the power of artificial ones. However, current approaches are mainly heuristic. With our systematic approach, we can directly related the information-theoretic fingerprint to learning and to performance on specific tasks. This enabled not only to characterize how the collective dynamics (see II.) relates to performance, but systematically derive the learning rules that enable optimal encoding of input. This combined study of information theory, learning and performance in living and artificial networks promises to unravel the role of biological learning rules in shaping human information processing.

                With the outbreak of COVID-19, we were confronted with the challenge to contain a disease that was widely unknown. Identifying efficient strategies for disease containment was urgently needed. With our expertise on inferring spreading dynamics in the brain even under subsampling, we could quickly act and quantify the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the reproduction number R in Germany. Since then, we have investigated, e.g., the “test-trace-and-isolate” strategy to break infection chains, the amount of measures necessary during vaccination roll-out, and the relationship between contact patterns and disease spread.
                Given the complex interactions between infectious disease dynamics and social dynamics, we increasingly focus on the impacts of risk awareness and the infodemic on the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks.
