  <strong>You may also want to look <a href="https://www.viola-priesemann.de/">at the old website</a> for more information.</strong><br> Our reseach focuses on the theory of complex systems, from information processing in neural networks to disease spread in population networks. We combine the study of learning and self-organization principles in these two types of networks with approaches from statistical physics and information theory. We thereby aim to improve the working of biologically-inspired artificial neural networks on the one hand, and to face future pandemics and similar health crises on the other hand.

            A classical problem when investigating complex systems is to infer
            their properties from measurements. However, these measurements are
            subject to uncertainties. For example, one can only sample a tiny
            fraction of all neurons in a brain. We showed how such subsampling can
            cause systematic biases and how to overcome them with
            subsampling-invariant estimators. More generally, we employ tools from
            Bayesian inference to include the uncertainty of data, e.g. from
            disease case numbers, for reliable estimates of collective properties.

            We want to understand how living neural networks process information.
            Does this require emergent correlations of their collective dynamics,
            as prevalent in so-called critical states, or does it require minimal
            redundancy and fast responses, as observed for so-called balanced
            states? We revisited these opposing hypotheses by analyzing spiking
            activity using subsampling-invariant approaches (see above) to find
            that many species operate in a novel regime, where they could flexibly
            tune computational properties in between critical and balanced state.
            We study mechanism of how neural networks self-organize towards either
            the critical or the balanced state depending on task requirements - a
            property that we call “dynamic, adaptive computation”.

            Information theory provides a natural language to quantify information
            processing independently of the imposed semantics. Hence, it enables
            us on the one hand to quantify the computational capacity of living
            and artificial neural networks. On the other hand, it provides the
            formal framework to derive learning rules systematically. Learning,
            from the synapse to the network level, tunes the performance of living
            systems, and unlocks the power of artificial ones. However, current
            approaches are mainly heuristic. With our systematic approach, we can
            directly related the information-theoretic fingerprint to learning and
            to performance on specific tasks. This enabled not only to
            characterize how the collective dynamics (see II.) relates to
            performance, but systematically derive the learning rules that enable
            optimal encoding of input. This combined study of information theory,
            learning and performance in living and artificial networks promises to
            unravel the role of biological learning rules in shaping human
            information processing.

            With the outbreak of COVID-19, we were confronted with the challenge
            to contain a disease that was widely unknown. Identifying efficient
            strategies for disease containment was urgently needed. With our
            expertise on inferring spreading dynamics in the brain even under
            subsampling, we could quickly act and quantify the impact of
            non-pharmaceutical interventions on the reproduction number R in
            Germany. Since then, we have investigated, e.g., the
            “test-trace-and-isolate” strategy to break infection chains, the
            amount of measures necessary during vaccination roll-out, and the
            relationship between contact patterns and disease spread. Given the
            complex interactions between infectious disease dynamics and social
            dynamics, we increasingly focus on the impacts of risk awareness and
            the infodemic on the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease
            outbreaks.

              data-abstract="The traditional long-term solutions for epidemic control involve eradication or population immunity. Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third viable solution: a stable equilibrium at low case numbers, where test-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local spreading events and only moderate restrictions remain necessary. In this equilibrium, daily cases stabilize around ten or fewer new infections per million people. However, stability is endangered if restrictions are relaxed or case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilization marks a tipping point beyond which the spread self-accelerates. We show that a lockdown can reestablish control and that recurring lockdowns are not necessary given sustained, moderate contact reduction. We illustrate how this strategy profits from vaccination and helps mitigate variants of concern. This strategy reduces cumulative cases (and fatalities) four times more than strategies that only avoid hospital collapse. In the long term, immunization, large-scale testing, and international coordination will further facilitate control."
